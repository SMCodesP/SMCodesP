### Hi friends!!

#### My studies

I am currently learning to analyze and design a system and trying to continue studying javascript with react.js (next.js), node.js and reactnative and java for very specific projects.

#### Colaborate

I'm not good at collaborating on public repositories, but sometimes I try to help with matters I don't know yet, so you can call me on my discord I would be very grateful.

#### Starting my profile

First I'm going to tell you what I'm doing with my life, well I'm currently working on 2 projects, one of them is my portfolio/store I still don't know how to define, and another is a server management app in minecraft, showing information like amount of money and information on the state of the server currently, but this project is not making much progress, there was a big problem with this company and they decided to stop innovations for a while, the intention of the app was to promote the admob ad by google, using expo
